"blazeswap-3.mdx","","FAQ

**Has the platform been audited?**
Yes, the platform has been audited by the specialized security firm Omniscia. No major issues have been found, and all minor issues have been addressed. The report is available here.

**Is there a bug bounty program?**
Yes, we have an active bug bounty program to reward users that find severe issues in the smart contracts of the DEX. For more details, see the dedicated page.

**Will I lose my FTSO rewards if I put liquidity into the BlazeSwap pools?**
No, you can safely put your FLR/SGB/CFLR/C2FLR into a liquidity pool and claim periodic rewards. The timings, amounts, and reward expirations mirror previous experiences—the only change is the interface for claiming.

**Will I lose the Flare Airdrop (FlareDrops) if I put liquidity into the BlazeSwap pools?**
No, on the Flare and Coston2 networks you can claim your monthly FlareDrop. The system uses three snapshots to distribute the airdrop, ensuring consistent timings, amounts, and expirations.

**What tokens can I trade?**
Any ERC-20 compliant fungible token can be traded. A curated list of known tokens is pre-defined, but you are free to add new ones. Note that NFTs are not supported.

**How can I get some free tokens to play with the DEX?**
On Coston/Coston2, you can exchange your CFLR/C2FLR for test tokens or mint them directly.

**Is there a BlazeSwap token or NFTs?**
No, the platform does not issue a governance or utility token. LP tokens suffice for provider delegation and token pairing.",2025-03-08 01:30:00
"blazeswap-4.mdx","","FAQ (continued)

**Will you add farming pools?**
No, there won’t be farming pools since there is no BlazeSwap token. Liquidity providers earn through trading fees, the main revenue source.

**What are the trader and liquidity provider fees?**
Each swap incurs a fixed 0.3% fee for traders, with liquidity providers receiving a proportional share.

**What are the platform fees?**
Currently, the platform has no fees. If fees are activated in the future, they will be announced at least 15 days in advance. A potential swap fee of 0.05% (reducing liquidity providers’ share to 0.25%) may apply.

**As a liquidity provider, may I incur an impermanent loss? What is it?**
Yes, impermanent loss is the potential loss from price divergence between when liquidity is added and removed. This loss is only realized upon withdrawal.

**What wallet do you support?**
Any web3-enabled wallet or one supporting WalletConnect v1. MetaMask, Rabby, and Bifrost/D'CENT have been tested; however, MetaMask Mobile is not recommended.

**Why does the interface stop working correctly after several MetaMask transactions?**
This is likely due to reaching the rate limit of the public Flare RPC endpoint, as MetaMask makes numerous RPC calls per transaction.

**Why don't I see my pools with custom tokens or rewards from removed liquidity when using the in-app Bifrost browser?**
Bifrost runs in incognito mode, which clears settings (like custom tokens and pool history) when the page is closed.

**Is it possible to perform swaps via API without the web interface?**
Yes, you can call the smart contracts directly in a manner similar to Uniswap V2. A npm package with the contract interfaces is available, with a potential SDK in the future.",2025-03-08 01:30:00
